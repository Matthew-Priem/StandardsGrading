	\item 
		Write a program that calculates then outputs the area of a trapezoid.  
		The user should be able to pick both bases and the height (that is: $a$, $b$, and $h$).\\
		Hint: $A = \dfrac{a+b}{2}h$

	\item 
		Write a program that calculates then outputs the volume of a right square pyramid.  
		The user should be able to pick $b$ (the base edge) and $h$ (the height).\\
		%Make sure to use the value of pi from the math module.\\
		Hint: $V = \dfrac{b^2 h}{3}$
