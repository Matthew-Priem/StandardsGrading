		They have a text file named \textit{CustomerData.txt} that has a date and the number of customers on that date.    
		There is one entry for every day this year.  A potion of that file is displayed below.  
		Write a program that calculates and then prints the total number of customers the business had last year.\\

		This question has two parts. You will create a file in part (a), and then use the created file in part (b). The two parts
		are meant to be independent. If you don't know how to create the file in part (a), you may assume its been created
		correctly for part (b).\\
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
				Create a file named $numbers.txt$ and write to it 100 randomly created integers between 250 and 500
				(inclusively). Each number should be written on a new line.\\
				Hint: Don't forget to import random.
			
			\item
				Cycle through each number in your newly created file, and print the word $even$ if it is even. Print the word $odd$
				if it is odd.
