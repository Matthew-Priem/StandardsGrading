	\item
		Write a function named $isPalindrome$ to determine if a string is a palindrome. It should take a single string as an argument
		and return True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. You may assume each input string has no punctuation, capitalization or spacing.
		Do not use the built-in function reverse().
		Clarification: A word is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards as it does backwards.
		For example, "bob" is a palindrome, and "neveroddoreven" is a palindrome.
		However, "helloworld" is not a palindrome because "helloworld" is different than "dlrowolleh"

		Write a function that takes a string and a letter as arguments. The function should return the amount of times
		the letter appears in the string. For example, if the string was "frantic running" and the letter was "n", the function should
		return 4 as "n" appears 4 times in the string.
		Do not use the built-in function count().

		Write a function that takes a string as an argument, loops through the string, and prints every other letter starting
		with the second letter. For example, if the word was "bellyflop", the function should print "elfo". If the word was
		"backflip", it should print "aklp".

		When driving in a car and approaching a traffic control light, \textit{green} means go, 
		\textit{yellow} means yield, and \textit{red} means stop.  Assuming there is a variable 
		named \textit{light\_color}, write a program that prints either the word \textit{go},

		Let the user input the value of \textit{light\_color}.

		Ask the user for two integers, \textit{larger} and \textit{smaller}.  Determine (and output) 
		how many times larger can be halved while still be greater than smaller.
		
		Examples:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item if \textit{larger} = 1324 and  \textit{smaller} = 98, the result should be 3 since
				1324 $\rightarrow$ 662 $\rightarrow$ 331 $\rightarrow$ 165.5
			\item if \textit{larger} = 624 and  \textit{smaller} = 8, the result should be 6 since\\
				\tab 624 $\rightarrow$ 312 $\rightarrow$ 156 $\rightarrow$ 78 $\rightarrow$ 39 
				$\rightarrow$ 19.5 $\rightarrow$ 9.75)

		In text analysis, finding the shortest word in a sentence is a common task. 
		Create a function called $shortest\_word$ that 
		takes the variable $sentence$ (a string) and returns the shortest word in the sentence. 

	\textbf{Examples:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item shortest\_word(\csq{the shining moon}) $\rightarrow$ \csq{the}
			\item shortest\_word(\csq{jumped on the trampoline}) $\rightarrow$ \csq{on}

		Reversing the order of words in a sentence can be helpful in text processing.

		A Sith infiltrator has scrambled the ancient Jedi texts, swapping the first half of each 
		passage with the second. You must help master Yoda restore the order of the archives. 
		Create a function called $swap\_sentence\_halves$ that takes the variable $sentence$ 
		(a string) and returns the sentence with the first half swapped with the second half. 
		If the sentence contains an odd number of words, the extra word should remain in the 
		second half. 

		\textbf{Examples:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item swap\_sentence\_halves(\csq{hello there general kenobi}) 
				$\rightarrow$ \csq{general kenobi hello there}
			\item swap\_sentence\_halves(\csq{the force will be with you always})

			\item swap\_sentence\_halves(\csq{do or not do there is no try}) 
				$\rightarrow$ \csq{there is no try do or not do}
