		A baseball player's batting average is calculated by the following formula:\\
		\begin{center}
		BA = (number of hits) / (number of official at-bats)\\
		\end{center}
		Batting averages are always expressed rounded to the nearest thousandth with no leading zero. 
		The top 3 MLB batting averages of all-time are:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Ty Cobb .366
			\item Rogers Hornsby .358
			\item Shoeless Joe Jackson .356
		\end{enumerate}
		The given list represents a season of games. Each list item indicates a player's [hits, official at bats] per game. 
		Write a \textbf{function} that takes in a list of $games$ (2 dimensional list) and returns a string with the player's
		 seasonal batting average rounded to the nearest thousandth.

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  batting\_avg([[0, 0], [1, 3], [2, 2], [0, 4], [1, 5]]) $\rightarrow$ \csq{.286},
			\item  batting\_avg([[2, 5], [2, 3], [0, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4]]) $\rightarrow$ \csq{.350},

		When coloring a striped pattern, you may start by coloring each square sequentially, meaning you spend time needing to switch coloring pencils.
		Write a \textbf{function} where given a list of colors $cols$, return how long it takes to color the whole pattern. Note the following times:
		\begin{itemize}

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  color\_pattern\_times([\csq{Red}, \csq{Blue}, \csq{Red}, \csq{Blue}, \csq{Red}]) $\rightarrow$ 14, Since there are 5 colors with 2 seconds each and you need to switch colors pencils 4 times.

		When painting a row of fence posts, you must change brushes whenever the color changes.
