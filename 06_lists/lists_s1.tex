	% Problem 1
	% Difficulty: 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		Write a \textbf{function} that loops through a word and returns a list with every 
		other letter of the word starting with the \textbf{first} letter.
		The function will take a single argument $word$ (a string representing the word to process).

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  skip\_letter(\csq{counterattack}) $\rightarrow$ 
				[\csq{c},\csq{u},\csq{t},\csq{r},\csq{t},\csq{a},\csq{c}]
			\item  skip\_letter(\csq{banana sunday}) $\rightarrow$
				[\csq{b},\csq{n},\csq{n},\csq{s},\csq{n},\csq{a}]
		\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		Write a \textbf{function} that loops through a word and returns a list with every 
		other letter of the word starting with the \textbf{second} letter.
		The function will take a single argument $word$ (a string representing the word to process).

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  skip\_letter(\csq{counterattack}) $\rightarrow$ 
				[\csq{o},\csq{n},\csq{e},\csq{a},\csq{t},\csq{c}]
			\item  skip\_letter(\csq{banana sunday}) $\rightarrow$
				[\csq{a},\csq{a},\csq{a},\csq{s},\csq{n},\csq{a}]

	% Problem 3
	% Difficulty: 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		Write a \textbf{function} that loops through and returns a list with every even number between two
		integers (inclusive). The arguments to the function will be $smaller\_num$ and 
		$larger\_num$.

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  output\_even(37, 1050) $\rightarrow$ [38, 40, 42, \dots 1048, 1050], 
			\item  output\_even(1, 2000) $\rightarrow$ [2, 4, 6, \dots 1998, 2000], 
			\item  output\_even(50, 199) $\rightarrow$ [50, 52, 54, \dots 196, 198]
		\end{itemize}

	% Problem 4
	% Difficulty: 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		Write a \textbf{function} that loops through and returns a list with every odd number between two
		integers (inclusive). The arguments to the function will be $smaller\_num$ and 
		$larger\_num$.

		\textbf{Examples:}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  output\_odd(37, 1050) $\rightarrow$ [37, 39, 41, \dots, 1049], 
			\item  output\_odd(1, 2000) $\rightarrow$ [1, 3, 5, \dots, 1999], 
			\item  output\_odd(50, 199) $\rightarrow$ [51, 53, 55, \dots, 197, 199]
