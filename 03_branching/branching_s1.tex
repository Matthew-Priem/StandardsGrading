%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item  
		When driving in a car and approaching a traffic control light, \textit{green} means go, 
		\textit{yellow} means yield, and \textit{red} means stop.  Assuming there is a variable 
		named \textit{light\_color}, write a program that prints either the word \textit{go}, 
		\textit{yield}, or \textit{stop} depending of the value of \textit{light\_color}.  
		Let the user input the value of \textit{light\_color}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item  
		Write a program that asks the user for three numbers, and then determines (and outputs) 
		which of the numbers is the largest.  Do not use the built-in function \textit{max}().\\
		For example, \\ \ \hfill
		\includegraphics[height = 0.6in]{./imgs/largest_ex1.PNG} \hfill
		\includegraphics[height = 0.6in]{./imgs/largest_ex2.PNG} \hfill \

		Write a program that asks the user for three numbers, and then determines (and outputs)
		which of the numbers is the smallest.  Do not use the built-in function \textit{min}().\\

	% Problem 11
	% Difficulty: 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item  
		(Game: heads or tails)  Write a program that lets the user guess whether the flip of a coin 
		results in heads or tails.  The program randomly generates an integer 0 or 1, which 
		represents head or tail.  The program prompts the user to enter a guess and reports whether 
		the guess is correct or incorrect.\\
		Hint: These should be your first two lines of code.
		\begin{verbatim}
		    from random import randint
		    value = randint(0,1) #picks a random integer. Either 0 or 1.
		\end{verbatim}

	% Difficulty: 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item  
		Write a program that prompts the user for a letter and checks whether the letter is a vowel 
		or consonant.  A vowel should output \textit{\csq{vowel}}, and a consonant should output 
		\textit{consonant}.  You may assume only lower case letters. Below is sample output.\\
		Hint: In the English language, a, e, i, o, and u are the vowels.
